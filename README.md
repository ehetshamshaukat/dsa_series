## Recommended Learning Path

To maximize your learning and interview readiness, consider the following approach:

1. **Foundation:** Start with arrays, strings, and basic data structures.
2. **Intermediate:** Move on to trees, graphs, and recursion.
3. **Advanced:** Practice dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and complex graph problems.
4. **Mock Interviews:** Simulate real interview conditions by timing yourself and explaining your thought process out loud.
5. **Review & Reflect:** Regularly revisit problems to reinforce concepts and improve efficiency.
